/* Hello, human. Welcome to style.css. Humans like yourself rarely venture beyond the boundaries of html, so I'm impressed with you. 
So impressed, in fact, that I'll hand over the secret. In order to sway the monstrous program, you must venture further 
among the forests of code, following this path that I've laid in store for you. Unfortunately, 
the only way to not be caught in this highly top secret endeavor, you must decrypt the message to get the password.
All I can provide you with is this: Y2hvY29sYXRlXyg0MXBfKDAwazEz. 
Now, adventurer, go. Bring me back the flag. I believe in you. */
