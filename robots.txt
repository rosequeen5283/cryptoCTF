Here's a little poem:

You have come for information.
I can tell you useful files.
But there's an issue - you must find
Every single file now.
On the path that is correct,
Every file you must check.
There's no hints, but I'll say;
The loop ends at kangaroo.
But unless you want an incomplete flag,
You'll have to work harder than that.
