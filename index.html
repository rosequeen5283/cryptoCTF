  <h1>Don't Get Lost</h1>
  <p>3 paths are avaliable to you, young adventurer. Good luck finding your way.</p>
  <p>The first path begins in the pecuilar forests of forest.txt. The next path requires venturing through the creepy factory of create.txt.</p>
  <p>And finally, perhaps the most dangerous, a txt that seems harmless - pineapple.txt. It may look harmless on the inside, but I heard it is very well guarded; so well guarded that you will not be able to brute force, following its instructions. It is simply a death loop. Adventurer, beware, it will be a difficult journey if you choose that path.</p>
  <p>I heard that perhaps there has been a leak. Some important information seems to have ventured into the txt files on one path; the path that starts with the 16th letter of the alphabet, apparently, but I don't have the time to figure out what the heck that is...</p>
  <p>Choose wisely, or it will be hard to venture back. Good luck, young adventurer. Good luck.</p>
